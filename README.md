### **How it works**
1. Captures the bid requests generated by fake-ad exchange.
2. Stores the bid requests in embedded Redis cache in queue.
3. Generates random Ad Campaigns to match with the bid request.
4. Matches ad campaigns to bid request pulled from Redis cache.
5. Selects winning bid when response api is called and returns data as json.


- Bid capture api : http://localhost:5758/bid/request [POST]
- Response api http://localhost:5758/bid/response [GET]

### **Bid matching criteria logic explanation**
In the data generated by the fake-ad exchange certain fields were observed to show randomness and the other fields were constant.
Random fields were: "banner", "placementId", "device", "lat" and "lon" fields in  "geo", "ip", "bcat".
Since the "at" value generated by fake-ad exchange is always zero, I have created a simple logic to select based on the highest bidding amount generated.
My solution generates random Ad campaigns per request between 1 to 50 based on the above mentioned random fields and the matching is done based on the following steps:
1. All campaigns which match the blocked IAB categories are excluded
2. Matching banner dimentions and placement id are selected
3. Device types are matched
4. Maximum price bid from remaining is selected
